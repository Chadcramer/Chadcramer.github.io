            <p>Hi, I'm Chad, a 23-year-old Full-Stack Web Developer. As a developer, and even in my day-to-day life, I strive for efficiency. But, in the reality of today's online world, being fast and responsive just doesn't cut it. Being effective today requires a keen balance between optimization and aesthetics.</p>
            <p>My love for programming started around late 2011, shortly after Minecraft had seen its official release. I started tinkering with the game purely out of curiosity, and to my surprise, I really enjoyed the challenge and creative process that came along with Java development. Over the years, I went onto work with some wonderful people, who would go onto become amazing friends and mentors.</p>
            <p>As time progressed, and the Minecraft community moved on, I began looking for another platform to mirror my creative desires. I had messed around with some web-based ideas before, but I had never fully immersed myself into the space - and man am I glad that I did.</p>
