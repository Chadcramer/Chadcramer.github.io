            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p class="history">I am a recent graduate of The University of Colorado with a BS in Finance. After graduating in early May of this year, I came to a realization that I have a rare opportunity where I can live at home, not worry about paying rent or taking classes, and that I can commit my free time to finally learn to program. 
                It was now or never, and I absolutely did not want to look back five or ten years from today and wish that I had learned earlier. 
                Since my graduation I have been sitting down and self-learning programming every single day, reading related books, taking online classes on EDX and Coursera, following an OSSU curriculum that aims to emulate a complete university education in computer science. As of today, I am going down the list and am currently taking "Introduction to Computer Networking", which will be my 11th programming related MOOC.
